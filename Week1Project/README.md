The only two files that are neccessary to run the program are Functions.sh and SWN-DC-Odds.sh.
SWN-DC-Odds.sh will create the data files if they do not exist.
if you don't already have a global stat file, the order of the stats are as follows:
# DC | mod | #rolls | avg | win% | spec | date
Note that the spacing may be different when not viewed through VS code
